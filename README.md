# Step 1: Create your Django project

[Back to master branch](https://github.com/mbrochh/django-reactjs-boilerplate/tree/master)

Ok. So you decided you want to use ReactJS with your new or existing Django
project. That's super cool. Since we don't have a project at hand, let's just
create a new one:

```bash
mkvirtualenv djreact
pip install Django
django-admin startproject djreact
mv djreact django
```

If you have never seen this `mkvirtualenv` command, you should take some time
and learn about [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) first.

This creates a new Django project in the root folder of your repository. I like
to rename that folder to `django` just because it will sit besides other
folders like `ansible` and maybe even `react-native`. I like the root folders
to describe the main technology that is used within them.

You also want to create a `requirements.txt` file and put `Django==1.9.3`
inside. If you have never used a `requirements.txt` file, have a look at the
[pip documentation](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/1.1/requirements.html).

And finally we should create a `.gitignore` file and add `*.pyc` files and
`db.sqlite3`.

At this point, you can run `./manage.py runserver` and you should see the
Django welcome page in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
